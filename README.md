Purple based theme for for your [Flarum](https://github.com/flarum) forum.

Hello all, i've just spilled some purple on the "Dark Flarum" design. I inspired by some space photos ([like this one](https://i.ibb.co/CPzZKv7/8h-IYog1-purple-galaxy-wallpaper.jpg)) and Travis Scott of course ðŸ˜„ It's only available in dark mode and the opposite is not one of my plans for now.

Alright, i hope you like it. Here are screenshots:
